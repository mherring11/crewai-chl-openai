The provided response is comprehensive, accurate, and clear, covering various aspects of web accessibility, its importance, benefits, and the services offered by an accessibility team. It also touches upon legal aspects and the business benefits of web accessibility. Therefore, I would rate this response as 95/100. The slight deduction is due to the fact that while the response is accurate and relevant, it's quite long and could potentially be condensed for clarity and brevity.
