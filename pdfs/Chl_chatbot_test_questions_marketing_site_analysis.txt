Evaluation and Score:
This response is relevant and clear, providing a brief overview of the services offered by the agency. However, it lacks detailed information and does not address specifics such as web accessibility, potential legal risks, SEO impacts, app development processes, maintenance and support services. Due to the lack of detail and the omission of key points, I would rate it a 60 out of 100.
